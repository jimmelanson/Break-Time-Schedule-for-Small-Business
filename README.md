# Break-Time-Schedule-for-Small-Business
A robust and free employee scheduler/break-time scheduler for a small business (with 25 or less employees working each day)

There are two principal advantages that this scheduling solution offers the small business person:
<br /><br />
1.) It will automatically determine and assign break times.
<br />
2.) It will create a legally defensible document in case of employee dispute.
<br /><br />
The setup for this workbook should take less than two hours. After that, to create a schedule you just need to enter employee names, the times that they start and end their shift, and then click a single button.
<br /><br />
If you are looking for a scheduling solution that will meet all of your principal needs for assigning duties and breaks, have a look at the screenshots. If you like, download the two manuals plus the workbook and enjoy --- and it's free.
